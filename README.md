## Structure
Work for each week of the competion is under `weekX`


## Get data

Run `python3 download_data.py weekX` to download the data for that week into the corresponding `weekX/data/raw` directory. If that doesnt work, ping me (Sean) on slack and I'll upload the new data sets.

E.g.: `python3 download_data.py week2` to download the data for week 2.
